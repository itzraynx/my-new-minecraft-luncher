## ▶️ Development

### Requirements

- Node 22.x.x
- Rust >= 1.85.1

### Pnpm

At this point make sure you have pnpm installed:

`npm install -g pnpm`

### Install Dependencies

`pnpm i`

### Run app in dev mode

First of all you'll need to generate the prisma code and rspc bindings. To do that run

`pnpm codegen`

Now you can run the native core in watch mode

`pnpm watch:core`
Note: Core module hot reload doesn't currently work on windows

Now open a new terminal and run the actual app

`pnpm watch:app`

### Generate DB migration

To generate a new migration please run

`pnpm prisma:migrate --name {migration_name}`

Replace `{migration_name}` with the name of the migration you want to create.

## 🔍 Test

To run tests please run

`pnpm test`

## </> Lint

To run lint please run

`pnpm lint`

## </> Code Formatting

A [`.editorconfig`](https://editorconfig.org/) is in the repo to normalize inconsistencies your editor may make when saving a file such as indentation and line endings. Make sure the plugin is installed for your editor.

## 🚚 Production

`pnpm build:{win|mac|linux}-{x64|arm64}`
